You might wonder how you can open those .a files. Currently there are no
tools available, and there is a reason to it.

Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has a lot of content that is unlocked as you
progress. It also contains some secrets.
We felt that having a folder with all the spritesheets, cutscene videos,
data files and whatnot would be too tempting for people to ignore.
Finding out things while playing the game, either alone, with friends,
or as part of an online community can be a very rewarding experience. We
don't want to take that away from you.

In case you like reverse engineering and absolutely want to take this
beautiful game apart, we would ask you a few things.
 - Don't release any secrets you find to the internet.
 - Don't publish information on how to open the game's data files.
 - Don't give away the unpacked resources.
The least you can do is wait until the game has been released for a
couple of months, so you don't accidentally spoil it for others.
